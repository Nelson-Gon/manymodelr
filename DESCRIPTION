Description: Frequently one needs a convenient way to build and tune
             several models in one go.The goal is to provide a number of convenience functions useful in machine learning 
             applications. It provides the ability to build, tune and obtain predictions of 
             several models in one function. The models are built using 'caret' functions with
             easier to read syntax.
