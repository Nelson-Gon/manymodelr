Description: Frequently one needs a convenient way to build and tune several models in one go.
             The goal is to provide a number of convenience functions useful in machine learning 
             applications. It provides the ability to build,tune and obtain predictions of 
             several models in one function. The models are built using the caret functions but
             with an easier to read syntax and the added advantage of 
             easy exploratory data analysis. The package harnesses caret's tuning power 
             while leveraging tidy syntax for user readability
             and like stated above easier exploratory data analysis. 
             In one function, one can easily know what model is working and fine tune for better performance.
