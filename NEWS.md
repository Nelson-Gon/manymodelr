# manymodelr 0.2.3

**Major Changes**

1. `modeleR` has been replaced with `fit_model` which is an easier to remember name. Usage remains the same.

2. `na_replace` has been extended to allow for user defined values. Grouping is not yet implemented. It may work with grouping functions(no guarantees, sorry!)
